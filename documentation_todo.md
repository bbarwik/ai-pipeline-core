# Documentation Todo - Execution Plan

## Docstring Template

### Module Docstring Template
```python
"""Module purpose and description.

This module provides [what it provides] for [use case].
Key features:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
"""
```

### Class Docstring Template
```python
"""Brief one-line description of the class.

Longer description explaining the purpose, usage, and behavior.
This class is used for [specific use case].

Attributes:
    attribute_name: Description of the attribute

Example:
    >>> instance = ClassName(param1="value")
    >>> result = instance.method()

Note:
    Important information about the class behavior or limitations.
"""
```

### Method/Function Docstring Template
```python
"""Brief one-line description of what the function does.

Longer description if needed, explaining the purpose and behavior.
This function is typically used when [use case].

Args:
    param1: Description of param1
    param2: Description of param2 (default: value)

Returns:
    Description of return value and type.

Raises:
    ExceptionType: When this exception is raised.

Example:
    >>> result = function_name(param1="value")
    >>> print(result)

Note:
    Important information about edge cases or special behavior.
"""
```

### Property Docstring Template
```python
"""Get/compute the [property name].

Returns the [what it returns] for [purpose].
This is computed [when/how].
"""
```

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Exception Classes [✓ COMPLETED]

- [x] ai_pipeline_core/documents/document_list.py - DocumentList and all methods
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/documents/flow_document.py - FlowDocument class
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/documents/task_document.py - TaskDocument class
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/documents/temporary_document.py - TemporaryDocument class
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/documents/utils.py - Utility functions
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/documents/mime_type.py - MIME type detection functions

### Phase 3: Flow System [✓ COMPLETED]
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/flow/config.py - FlowConfig class and methods
- [x] ai_pipeline_core/flow/options.py - FlowOptions class

### Phase 4: LLM Module
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/llm/ai_messages.py - AIMessages class and methods
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/llm/client.py - Generate functions and helpers
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/llm/model_options.py - ModelOptions class
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/llm/model_response.py - ModelResponse and StructuredModelResponse
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/llm/model_types.py - Type definitions (if needed)

### Phase 5: Logging System
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/logging/logging_config.py - LoggingConfig class and functions
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/logging/logging_mixin.py - All mixin classes and methods

### Phase 6: Core Modules
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/pipeline.py - Pipeline decorators and protocols
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/prefect.py - Prefect exports (if needed)
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/prompt_manager.py - PromptManager class
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/settings.py - Settings class
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/tracing.py - Tracing decorator and TraceInfo

### Phase 7: Simple Runner
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/simple_runner/cli.py - CLI functions
- [ ] ai_pipeline_core/simple_runner/simple_runner.py - Runner functions

### Phase 8: Verification
- [ ] Review all files for completeness
- [ ] Check for consistency in docstring style
- [ ] Verify examples are correct
- [ ] Test that code still runs properly

## Progress Tracking

Total Files: 24
Completed: 9  (exceptions + 7 document files)
In Progress: 2 (flow module)
Remaining: 13

## Notes for Execution

1. Each docstring should explain:
   - WHAT the code does
   - WHY it exists (purpose)
   - WHEN to use it
   - HOW to use it (with examples for complex functions)

2. For abstract methods, explain what subclasses should implement

3. For validators and serializers, explain validation rules

4. For properties, explain if they're computed or cached

5. For async functions, mention they must be awaited

6. For decorators, explain the transformation they perform

7. Include warnings about deprecated functions or those that shouldn't be used directly

8. Reference related functions/classes where appropriate

9. For protocol classes, explain what they represent and how they're used

10. For type aliases, explain what they represent

## Current Status: Phase 3 - Flow System
