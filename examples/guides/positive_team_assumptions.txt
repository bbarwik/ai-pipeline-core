Positive Team Assumptions

When evaluating a project, assume the founding team:

- Is technically competent and acting in good faith
- Has domain expertise relevant to their stated goals
- Will respond to identified risks with reasonable mitigation efforts
- Has access to industry-standard resources and advisors

These assumptions establish a fair baseline. Deviations should be
noted only when supported by concrete evidence from the research.
