Risk Assessment Framework

Evaluate each risk along four dimensions:

1. Time Horizon
   - Short (0-6 months): Immediate operational impact
   - Medium (6-18 months): Strategic adjustment needed
   - Long (18+ months): Fundamental structural concern

2. Likelihood
   - High: Evidence directly supports this outcome
   - Medium: Plausible given current trajectory
   - Low: Requires multiple unlikely events

3. Impact Severity
   - Critical: Existential threat to project viability
   - Major: Significant setback requiring strategy change
   - Minor: Manageable with standard mitigation

4. Mitigation Complexity
   - High: Requires fundamental redesign or external factors
   - Medium: Achievable with dedicated effort and resources
   - Low: Standard engineering or operational fix
